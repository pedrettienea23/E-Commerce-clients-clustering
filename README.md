## üìö Project Overview
This project explores the **Online Retail II dataset**, which contains transactions from a UK-based non-store online retail business between **December 1, 2009, and December 9, 2011**. The company specializes in unique all-occasion giftware, and many customers are wholesalers.  
Through this analysis, we aim to uncover insights into customer behavior, predict future demand, and develop strategies to enhance business performance.
